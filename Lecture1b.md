# What is a LAMP stack?
---
**Step 0 - Preparing prerequisites**

In order to complete this project you will need an AWS account and a virtual server with Ubuntu Server OS.

[AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) is the biggest Cloud Service Provider and it offers a free tier account that we are going to leverage for our projects.

Do not focus too much on AWS itself right now, there will be a proper Cloud introduction and configuration projects later in our course.

Right now, all we need to know is that AWS can provide us with a free virtual server called [EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/features/) for our needs.

A **LAMP** stack is a bundle of four different software technologies that developers use to build websites and web applications. LAMP (as learnt in previous lecture) is an acronym for the operating system - Linux, the web server - Apache, the database server - MySQL, and the programming language - PHP. All four of these technologies are open source, which means they are community maintained and freely available for anyone to use. Developers use LAMP stacks to create, host, and maintain web content. It is a popular solution that powers many of the websites you commonly use today.

Linux Linux is an open-source operating system that you can install and configure to meet different application requirements. Linux sits at the first level of the LAMP stack and supports other components on the upper layers.

In order to complete this project, you will need an AWS account and a virtual server with Ubuntu Server OS. NB; AWS is not the focus now, all we need to know now is that AWS can provide us with a free virtual server called [EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/features/) for our needs.

Follow the instructions below.

Step 1: Set Up Your AWS Account

2. Access the AWS Management Console: Log in to the AWS Management Console where you’ll manage your services.

Step 2: Launch an EC2 Instance
