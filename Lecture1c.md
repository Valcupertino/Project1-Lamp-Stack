# Install Apache
## What is Apache;
Apache [Apache HTTP Server](https://httpd.apache.org/) is an open-source web server that forms the second layer of the LAMP stack. The Apache module stores website files and exchanges information with a browser using HTTP, an internet protocol for transferring website information in plain text. For example, when a browser requests a webpage, the Apache HTTP server does the following:
1. Receives the request
2. Processes the request and finds the required page file
3. Sends the relevant information back to the browser

We will install Apache using Ubuntuâ€™s package manager ['apt']

4. Update Software Packages: Run;
```
sudo apt update -y
