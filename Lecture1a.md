# WEB STACK IMPLEMENTATION (LAMP STACK)
---
## Welcome to your very first Project

A technology stack, often referred to as a tech stack, is a combination of software products and programming languages used to create a web or mobile application. It encompasses all the technologies required to develop and run a single application, including both the backend (server-side) and frontend (client-side) components.

Example of a Tech Stack includes;

* **LAMP** (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP or Python, or Perl)
* **LEMP** (Linux, Nginx, MySQL, PHP or Python, or Perl)
* **MERN** (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS)
* **MEAN** (MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, NodeJS)

**Side Self Study**

1. Conduct a Google search on what software development life cycle (SDLC) is and document your finding in a Google word file.
2. Conduct another Google search, understand what LAMP stack means.
3. Read about 'chmod' and 'chown' commands in Linux and understand how access and ownership of files and directories work.
4. Learn what TCP and UPD terms mean and how they are different. List down ports most commonly used in Web (http, https, ssh, telnet, ftp, sftp, telnet)
5. Get yourself familiar with basic text editing in [Vi (Vim)](https://www.vim.org/) editor. [Practice here](https://openvim.com/).
